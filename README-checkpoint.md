Conclusion and Future Scope
This research aids in the comprehension of survey results based on the respondent's description of a general mental illness. The data is collected to keep a check on mental health in tech organizations across the globe. The different aspects of the dataset help in understanding how mental health is important. This research aids in the comprehension of survey results based on the respondent's description of a clinician-diagnosed depression. It reveals that a substantial percentage of survey respondents in the tech industry suffers from mental illness.
The key hurdles were training the models and incorporating several machine learning techniques to get the highest level of accuracy. Cleaning such a large volume of data while keeping a careful watch on the required parameters and deleting those that are not, was also
a time-consuming operation. 
After comparing the result; the CatBoost algorithm showed promising results as compared to XGBoost and LightGBM. For Future work, datasets with more sample sizes with different collection methods could further help in analyzing specifics of mental illnesses such as depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation and execute the model in parallel threads for such an enormous dataset to improve performance.
